                    <p>I am a Principal Scientist Manager at Microsoft (since 2021) - based out of the Cambridge, UK office - where I work on AI for human understanding for Presence and Mixed Reality - in products such as Teams and Microsoft Mesh.</p> 
                    <p>Up to 2021 I was a full time Professor Computer Science at the University of Bath, where I joined as a Royal Academy of Engineering/ EPSRC Research Fellow in 2007 and still hold a small part-time position. I have been fortunate enough to be awarded two previous Research Fellowships: Royal Academy of Engineering, 2007-2012, Royal Society Industry Fellowship (with Double Negative Visual Effects), 2012-2016.</p> 
                    <p> In 2015 I founded and was Director of the <a>Centre for the Analysis of Motion, Entertainment Research and Applications (CAMERA)</a>, funded by EPSRC/AHRC, with partner contributions from The Imaginarium, The Foundry, British Skeleton, Ministry of Defence and British Maritime Technologies. In 2020 I led the successful re-funding of CAMERA for another 5 years (EPSRC) and helped secure the Â£45m+ MyWorld project in the South West of the UK. <p/> <p>My primary research interest has always been on human motion analysis, recognition and synthesis - particulary for animation with applications in Video Games, Virtual Worlds, Mixed Reality and Movies.</p> <!--<p><font color="#FF0004"><b>PhD/Post-Doctoral Researcher Opportunities!</b></font>I am currently looking for a post-doctoral researcher with a background in 3D computer vision, ideally with application areas/interests in real time tracking. There are also PhD opportunities within CAMERA in several areas across motion capture and animation. Experience/interest in Computer Vision, Graphics and/or machine learning is desirable. Please email me for enquiries.</p>-->

                    <p>I have always been a believer that you shouldn't do research and then just 'throw it over the wall' for others to take to real users and customers. In fact, most of the hard - and really interesting work - starts when you get your great reseach ideas into real people hands. Then you find out a few things - does it really work on real data? Is it robust? You will discover dozens of things that are wrong,  could be improved, and even better a set of new problems. At Microsoft I have been fortunate to get research into the hands of millions of customers through Mesh and Teams. In <a href="http://www.camera.ac.uk">CAMERA</a> I created a model whereby we translated research into impact by creating tools from our research, deploying them into our studio, and then delivering projects to clients that leverage these tools. Below is a snapshot of some of the projects I have been fortunate enough to be involved in!</p>

                <p>I have always been interested in people - and understanding how they move so we can model this and then learn to create better animation systems. This involves peoples faces, bodies, the environment, each other - and then the application to video games, movies, remote communication. I believe motion should always be higher fidelity than appearance - and poor appearance and great motion will always be better than great appearance and poor motion.</p> 
                <p>Along this direction I have explored many projects in the past - both in academia and industry - and established new teams as well as multiple commercial grade motion capture production studios. Below is an overview of my research based on different areas I have worked on. It is a representative list of papers only by broad topic area - for a full list see the <a href="#papers">research papers</a> section.</p>

You can get the data, code to view and the CVPR 2020 paper it is all based on from our <a href="https://github.com/CAMERA-Bath/RGBD-Dog">GitHub page</a>. In our CVPR 2020 paper we use the data to train a model to predict dog pose from RGBD data. However, it also works pretty well on other animals. In the future we will expand the data and code as we publish more of our research. </p> 
                    <p><b>D3DFACS</b> The D3DFACS Dataset contains over 500 FACS coded dynamic 3D (4D) sequences from 10 individuals - including 3D meshes, stereo UV maps, colour camera images and calibration files. You can find out more about it in our ICCV 2011 paper "<a href="ICCV_final_2011.pdf">A FACS Valid 3D Dynamic Action Unit Database with Applications to 3D Dynamic Morphable Facial Modelling</a>". If you would like to download the dataset for academic research, <a href="https://vision.cs.bath.ac.uk/facedata">please visit the data set website</a></p> 
                    <p><b>Shadow
			Removal Ground Truth and Evaluation</b> To encourage the open comparison of single image
                  shadow removal in community, we provide an online
                  benchmark site and a dataset. Our quantitatively
                  verified high quality dataset contains a wide range of
                  ground truth data (214 test cases in total). Each case
                  is rated according to 4 attributes, which are texture,
                  brokenness, colourfulness and softness, in 3
                  perceptual degrees from weak to strong. To access the
                  evaluation website, <a href="http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/%7Ehg299/shadow_eval/">please visit here</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a collection of previous activities - including workshops (at CVPR, ACCV, etc) and EPSRC research networks I have co-founded - kept here for future reference (mine as much as anything!)</p> <br> 
<h3>EPSRC Network on Visual Image Interpretation in Humans and Machines (ViiHM)</h3> 
<p> 
Understanding the environment via the sense of vision represents a challenging problem in computer science. Yet biological vision, as evidenced in the human visual system, seems to process the visual environment effortlessly. This supports the notion that understanding biological vision will help to solve problems in machine vision. However, some of the biggest advances in our understanding of human vision have occurred as a direct result of modern computing techniques. We can only really say we understand a complex system fully when we can recreate or simulate it, test hypotheses on the simulation, and take the simulation to the limits of its validity. 
The aims of the EPSRC VIIHM Network are: 
1.       To foster communication and joint projects between relevant research groups including those working on biological vision (human and non-human animals) computer vision and machine vision.
2.       To establish a series of grand challenges focused around well specified tasks where cross-over studies have a strong potential to provide robust solutions.
3.       To foster joint cross-discipline grant applications.
4.       To explore mechanisms to improve the utility of joint publications for both partners.
5.       To equip individual PhD and post-doctoral scientists to be future leaders of cross-over research projects.
6.       To establish a lasting vehicle for supporting cross-over biological and machine vision projects.
7.       To increase public engagement with the concept of biologically inspired computer vision. 
You can join and register for our first workshop at the same time or just join the Network here: http://www.viihm.org.uk</p> <br> 
<h3>EPSRC Network on Vision and Language (V&L Net)</h3> 
<p> 
The EPSRC Network on Vision and Language (V&L Net) is a forum for researchers from the fields of Computer Vision and Language Processing to meet, exchange ideas, expertise and technology, and form new partner- ships. Our aim is to create a lasting interdisciplinary research community situated at the language-vision interface, jointly working towards solutions for some of today's most challenging computational challenges, including image and video search, description of visual content and text-to-image generation.  
As a research collaboration forum, V&L Net has a real-life and a virtual dimension. We hold annual V&L Net meetings which combine the characteristics of an academic conference, a networking event and an exhibition. At the same time, the V&L Net website offers a wide variety of different tools and resources including networking tools and repositories of publications, data resources and software tools <p> <br> <h3>2nd Meeting of the EPSRC Network on Visual Image Interpretation in Humans and Machines (ViiHM), July 1st/2nd, 2015</h3> <p>We invite all academics and relevant industrial practitioners interested in the fostering of human and computer vision research to the first annual meeting of the EPSRC VIIHM Network. The annual meeting will focus on community building and will comprise of plenary talks from internationally renowned human and computer vision researchers, networking and community building opportunities and poster sessions. 
Full workshop details may be found here http://www.viihm.org.uk/home/events/second-workshop/</p> <br> <h3>2nd Workshop on User Centric Computer Vision (UCCV), 2014</h3> <p> 
UCCV 2014 is a workshop dedicated to research on interactive computer vision and methods for making computer vision more accessible to wider audiences. The workshop welcomes work on case studies, end-user applications, developer-centred approaches and many other aspects of computer vision.  
1st Meeting of the EPSRC Network on Visual Image Interpretation in Humans and Machines (ViiHM), September 24th-25th, 2014 
We invite all academics and relevant industrial practitioners interested in the fostering of human and computer vision research to the first annual meeting of the EPSRC VIIHM Network. The annual meeting will focus on community building and will comprise of plenary talks from internationally renowned human and computer vision researchers, networking and community building opportunities and poster sessions. 
Up to 80 applicants will then be invited to attend the workshop - based on a balance of early, mid and advanced career researchers. We will also aim to balance the mix of disciplines.
The meeting duration is from midday on the 24th to the afternoon of 25th September. Those interested should complete the form below and send it to the Network Administrator by 30th June 2014. Workshop applicants may optionally request a poster presentation using the same form. Posters may represent new work, a review of past work, an outline of planned work or position piece, or an outline of collaboration interests and opportunities. 
Full workshop details may be found here http://viihm.org.uk/workshop.html</p> <br> <h3>3rd Workshop On Vision And Language 2014 (VL'14), Dublin, 23rd August 2014 </h3> <p> 
Fragments of natural language, in the form of tags, captions, subtitles, surrounding text or audio, can aid the interpretation of image and video data by adding context or disambiguating visual appearance. In addition, labelled images are essential for training object or activity classifiers. On the other hand, visual data can help resolve challenges in language processing such as word sense disambiguation. Studying language and vision together can also provide new insight into cognition and universal representations of knowledge and meaning. Meanwhile, sign language and gestures are languages that require visual interpretation.  
We welcome papers describing original research combining language and vision. To encourage the sharing of novel and emerging ideas we also welcome papers describing new datasets, grand challenges, open problems, benchmarks and work in progress as well as survey papers.

The EPSRC Network on Vision and Language (V&L Net) is a forum for researchers from the fields of Computer Vision and Language Processing to meet, exchange ideas, expertise and technology, and form new partner- ships. Our aim is to create a lasting interdisciplinary research community situated at the language-vision interface, jointly working towards solutions for some of today's most challenging computational challenges, including image and video search, description of visual content and text-to-image generation.  
As a research collaboration forum, V&L Net has a real-life and a virtual dimension. We hold annual V&L Net meetings which combine the characteristics of an academic conference, a networking event and an exhibition. At the same time, the V&L Net website offers a wide variety of different tools and resources including networking tools and repositories of publications, data resources and software tools. The networks home page may be found here. </p> <br> <h3>Eurographics UK - Theory and Practice of Computer Graphics 2013</h3> <p> 
The 31st Conference organised by the UK chapter of the Eurographics Association took place at the University of Bath on the 5-6 September 2013. The aim of this conference is to focus on theoretical and practical aspects of Computer Graphics and to bring together top practitioners, users and researchers, which will inspire further collaboration between participants particularly between academia and industry.  
The meeting website contains more details of the event.</p> <h3>IEEE CVPR Workshop on Vision and Language 2013</h3> <p> 
The EPSRC Network on Vision and Language (V&L Net) has been set up to foster collaborative work in this area. It is a forum for researchers from the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to meet, exchange ideas, expertise and technology, and form new partnerships. The aim is to create a lasting interdisciplinary research community situated at the language-vision interface, jointly working towards solutions for some of today's most challenging computational challenges, including image and video search, description of visual content and text-to-image generation. A workshop on this theme - held jointly with CVPR - took place in 2013.

The aim of this meeting is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry â particularly in VFX and games - interested in all aspects of facial animation and related analysis. The meeting has previously been held in Edinburgh (2009/2010) and Vienna (2012). Watch this space for future meetings! </p> <h3>AVA/BMVA Biological and Computer Vision (2011,2012)</h3> <p> 
The study of biological and machine vision share much common history (e.g. Marr), and each discipline has benefited enormously from findings and techniques from the other.  In the UK (in contrast to elsewhere) the discussion and collaboration between the sister disciplines seems to have declined. The aim of this meeting, organised jointly by the Applied Vision Association (AVA) (UK biological vision) and British Machine Vision Association (BMVA) (UK computer vision) is to reignite conversations between these two fields. 
The meeting was held at Cardiff University (2011) and at Microsoft Research, Cambridge (2012). Watch this space for 2013 meeting information</p> <div id="copyright"> <span>&copy; Darren Cosker.
